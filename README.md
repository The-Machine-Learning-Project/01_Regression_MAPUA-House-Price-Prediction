# House-Price-Prediction

A Real Estate Brokerage Firm asked to determine the 
reasonable selling price of the 100+ units of new properties that they just 
acquired. They have historical data of 300 units that they sold in the past 
and they have new 100+ units to be sold. They want the pricing model of 
the new100+ units to be consistent with the pricing of the units that they 
have sold in the past.

In this problem, I utilized Multiple Linear Regression to predict the selling price of newly acquired properties
